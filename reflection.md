My class named game allows gamer to choose different steps. The fruits are experience point that a user can get, use, drop, etc. Moreover, there're different experience point bonus for users to explore. 

The grab method allows user to grab a fruit, and add the length of the fruit's name to the experience points of the player.
The drop method sallows user to drop a fruit, and remove the length of the fruit's name to the experience points of the player.
 The examine method is used to examine a fruit tree and obtain information about the fruit on the tree. 
The use method allows user to use a fruit. The experience points of the player will decrease 2 points per use.
The walk method is used for gamers to walk in a specified direction.
The fly method is used for gamers to fly in a specified direction.
